Analyse statistical features of genesets on transcription level. Filter for genesets with specific patterns based on those statistics.

### TODO list
1. Searching for more multi-state/time series datasets from GEO.
2. Try spliting genesets according to their expression correlation.
3. Analyze results from current datasets.
